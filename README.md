# Cross-Doc-gui

A graphical user interface for [cross-doc](https://github.com/dorward/cross-doc)

## Installation

Use NPM to install cross-doc-gui.

You'll probably need to fiddle with `package.json` to point it to the correct
URL for cross-doc as I'm developing locally at present.

## Usage

I haven't written usage instructions yet, and don't have a sample project
available to the public. Good luck.

## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, you may wish to open an issue
first to discuss what you would like to change as rejection after doing the
work may hurt.
